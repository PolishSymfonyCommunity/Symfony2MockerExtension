Symfony2 Mocker Extension
=========================

Behat extension for mocking services defined in the Symfony2 dependency
injection container.

**Use it sparingly. Mocking a service container is not a good practice.
Most of the time if there's a need for this,
the problem can be better solved by improving the design instead.**

Internally it uses [Mockery](https://github.com/padraic/mockery) and
[SymfonyMockerContainer](https://github.com/PolishSymfonyCommunity/SymfonyMockerContainer).
